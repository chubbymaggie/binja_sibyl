# binja_sibyl

A Miasm2 + binaryninja based function divination.

## What it does

[Sybil](https://github.com/cea-sec/Sibyl) is a tool to recognize standard functions based on their side effects.
For a detailed introduction see [Sybil's README](https://github.com/cea-sec/Sibyl/blob/master/README.md).

## Speed

Currently, binja_sibyl uses a single thread so, as of now, it's slower than running Sibyl manually.

## Props

Shout out to Camille MOUGEY, the author os Sibyl.
The underlying is pretty clever.
